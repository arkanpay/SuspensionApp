# Suspension Analyzer - App Overview

## What It Does

A local Android app that **tests vehicle suspension performance** through standardized driving tests and provides a **scored performance report**.

## Core Concept

1. **Select a standardized test** (Figure-8 or Standing Start/Stop)
2. **Drive the test** with phone mounted in vehicle
3. **Get scored results** based on suspension performance metrics
4. **Share the report** with others

## How It Works

### Step 1: Calibrate Sensors
- Mount phone in vehicle
- Place phone on dashboard (or use mount)
- Calibrate sensors to zero out mounting angle

### Step 2: Select Test Protocol
Choose from:
- **Standing Start/Stop** - Tests acceleration/braking performance
- **Figure-8** - Tests cornering and body roll control

### Step 3: Run The Test
- App displays 3D car orientation in real-time
- Shows live G-force readings
- Timer counts down test duration
- You drive according to test instructions

### Step 4: Get Scored Results
App analyzes sensor data and generates:
- **Overall Score** (0-100)
- **Performance Rating** (Excellent, Good, Average, Fair, Poor)
- **Category Scores** (Acceleration, Braking, Cornering, Smoothness)
- **Detailed Metrics** (Peak G-forces, consistency, etc.)

### Step 5: Share Results
- Generate text report
- Share via any app (Messages, Email, etc.)

## Test Protocols

### Standing Start/Stop Test
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

**Instructions:**
1. Start from complete stop
2. Accelerate smoothly to 40 mph
3. Brake smoothly to complete stop

**Measures:**
- **Acceleration Performance** (0-100 score)
  - Peak longitudinal G during acceleration
  - Higher = better acceleration capability
- **Braking Performance** (0-100 score)
  - Peak longitudinal G during braking
  - Higher = better braking capability
- **Smoothness** (0-100 score)
  - Vertical G-force variation
  - Lower variation = better suspension control

**Scoring:**
```
Peak Accel G    Score
> 0.8 G         100
> 0.6 G         85
> 0.4 G         70
> 0.2 G         50
< 0.2 G         30
```

### Figure-8 Test
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

**Instructions:**
1. Find safe, empty area (parking lot)
2. Drive figure-8 pattern
3. Maintain consistent 20-25 mph
4. Complete at least 2 full figure-8s

**Measures:**
- **Cornering Performance** (0-100 score)
  - Peak lateral G during turns
  - Higher = better cornering grip
- **Consistency** (0-100 score)
  - Lateral G-force variation
  - Lower variation = better control
- **Body Roll Control** (0-100 score)
  - Vertical stability during turns
  - Lower variation = better suspension

**Scoring:**
```
Peak Lateral G  Score
> 0.7 G         100
> 0.5 G         85
> 0.4 G         70
> 0.3 G         50
< 0.3 G         30
```

## Scoring System

### Overall Score Calculation

**Standing Start/Stop:**
- 40% Acceleration Score
- 40% Braking Score
- 20% Smoothness Score

**Figure-8:**
- 50% Cornering Score
- 30% Consistency Score
- 20% Body Roll Control Score

### Rating Scale
```
90-100: Excellent  (High-performance suspension)
75-89:  Good       (Above average performance)
60-74:  Average    (Typical performance)
40-59:  Fair       (Below average)
0-39:   Poor       (Needs attention)
```
